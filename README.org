* Loading packages

By default, all packages are loaded with =:ensure= and =:defer= keywords.

To load a =library= which is not a package, one has to use =:ensure nil= statement in the =use-package= declaration:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package library
  :ensure nil)
#+end_src

If a =package= (or library) has to be loaded as soon as some =feature= loads with the use of =:after= keyword, then one has to explicitly add also =:demand= keyword to the =use-package= declaration:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package package
  :demand :after feature)
#+end_src
Note that =:demand= will not force the package to be loaded at startup in this case.
It will actually be deferred until =feature= is loaded.

* Adding a hook to run in a particular mode

Use the following snippet:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/setup-<smth>-in-<some>-mode ()
  "Description."
  (add-hook '<hook-name> #'<smth> nil t))
(add-hook '<some>-mode-hook #'my/setup-<smth>-in-<some>-mode)
#+end_src
